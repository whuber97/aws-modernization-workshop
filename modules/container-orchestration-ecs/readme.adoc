=== Introduction

In this module, we're going to deploy applications using http://aws.amazon.com/ecs/[Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)] to
orchestrate our containers on top of http://aws.amazon.com/fargate/[AWS Fargate] using
http://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/[AWS Cloud9] to drive our development and deployment.

==== Getting Started with Amazon ECS using AWS Fargate

Before we get started, here are some definitions you need to understand in order to deploy your application when creating your first Amazon ECS cluster.

[options="header"]
|=======================
| Object | Cluster
| Cluster | Logical grouping of tasks and services. Infrastructure may be shared between tasks and services running on the same cluster.
| Task Definition | Blueprint for our application. Defines attributes such as CPU and memory requirements, networking configuration, and container definitions.
| Container Definition | Configuration for a container to run as part of our task. Defines attributes of the container including port mappings, resources requirements, environment variables, etc.
| Service | Maintains a specified number of running simultaneous instances of a task definition in an ECS cluster.
|=======================

You'll deploy a service via Amazon ECS using AWS Fargate as the launch type. The Fargate launch type allows you to run your containerized applications
without the need to provision and manage the backend infrastructure. Amazon ECS also can launch tasks and services using the EC2 launch type which runs containerized
applications on Amazon EC2 instances that you manage. Amazon ECS is the orchestration service responsible for running docker containers and AWS Fargate is the underlying
compute platform where the containers will run.

===== Deploy our VPC 

We will first deploy our CloudFormation template which configures our ECS VPC.

1. Switch to the tab where you have your Cloud9 environment opened and change to this modules directory by running:
+
[source,shell]
----
cd ~/environment/aws-modernization-workshop/modules/container-orchestration-ecs
----
+
2. Deploy the CloudFormation template
+
[source,shell]
----
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name "petstore" \
  --template-body file://petstore-fargate-cf-resources.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
----
+
3. Wait for the Template to finish deploying
+
[source,shell]
----
until [[ `aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name "petstore" --query "Stacks[0].[StackStatus]" --output text` == "CREATE_COMPLETE" ]]; do  echo "The stack is NOT in a state of CREATE_COMPLETE at `date`";   sleep 30; done && echo "The Stack is built at `date` - Please proceed"
----

===== Amazon ECS Task definitions

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html[Amazon ECS Task definitions] are required to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS.
For our pestore application, we will review the key pieces of a task definition before we deploy it.

1. Switch to the tab where you have your Cloud9 environment opened.
+
2. Open the *petstore-fargate-task-definition.json* file by double clicking the filename in the lefthand navigation in Cloud9.
+
3. The file has the following contents:
+
.petstore-fargate-task-definition.json
[source,json]

===== Create the Petstore Service with Amazon ECS using Fargate

1. Go to the AWS Management Console, click Services then select *Elastic Container Service* under Compute.
+
2. On the left hand navigation ensure *Clusters* is selected and click *Create Cluster*.
+
3. On the *Select cluster template* screen select *Networking only* which should have a *Powered by AWS Fargate* label and click *Next step*.
+
4. Enter a Cluster name of *petstore-workshop* and leave the Create VPC box *unchecked* and click *Create*.
+
5. Once your cluster is created, view your cluster and the *Services* tab should be seleced. Click *Create*.
+
6. Select a *Launch type* of *FARGATE*
+
7. Select *petstore* and the latest *revision* for the *Task Definition*.
+
8. Enter *petstore* for the *Service name*.
+
9. Enter *1* into *Number of tasks* and click *Next step*.
+
10. Select the *petstore* VPC for *Cluster VPC*.
+
11. Select the two *Public* petstore Subnets for *Subnets*.
+
12. For *Security Groups* click *Edit* then click *Select an existing Security Group*. Select the *default* Security Group and click Save. You will notice that
the default Security Group only allows port 8080 from PetStoreLbSecurityGroup to secure our petstore application.

13. Select *ENABLED* from *Auto-assign public IP*. This allows your tasks to retrieve the Docker image from Amazon ECR and stream logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

14. Set the *Health check grace period* to *300*. Note: This is the period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler should ignore unhealthy
Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after a task has first started. This is only valid if your service
is configured to use a load balancer. If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to health checks,
you can specify a health check grace period of up to 7,200 seconds during which the ECS service scheduler ignores the health check status.
This grace period can prevent the ECS service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.
+
15. Under Load Balancing, select the Application Load Balancer and make sure *petstore-lb* is selected.
+
16. For *Container to load balance* select *petstore:8080:8080* and click *Add to load balancer*.
+
17. Type in 80 for the *Listener port* and ensure it is set to *create new*.
+
18. Ensure that *Target group name* is set to *create new* and the name should be *ecs-petsto-petstore.
+
19. *Uncheck* the box for *Enable service discovery integration* and click *Next step*.
+
20. The next page allows you to define an Auto Scaling policy. Leave this set to *Do not adjust the service's desired count* for now and click *Next step*.
+
21. Review your settings and click *Create Service*.
+
22. The service will now start your task. Click *View Service* and you will have to wait for your task to transition to *RUNNING*. Feel free to inspect the logs for your task while you wait.
+
23. Once the task is running, view the *Details* of the petstore *Service*. Under *Load Balancing* click the *ecs-petsto-petstore* Target Group link to view
the Tasks being registerd into the Target Group under *Targets*.
+
24. Once your Registerd Target is registered as *Healthy* you can view the service through the Application Load Balancer.
+
25. Click on the *Load Balancing* link on the left hand navigation pane of the EC2 window to view your Application Load Balancer.
+
26. Get the URL for your running application
+
[source,shell]
----
printf "http://%s/applicationPetstore\n" $(aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --names="petstore-lb" --query="LoadBalancers[0].DNSName" --output=text)
----
+
27. Open the URL output above in your Browser.

Now that we have a Fargater cluster deployed we can move on with the workshop.
